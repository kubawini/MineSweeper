# MineSweeper
Part of Harvard CS50 AI course. MineSweeper game with AI elements.

## About project
This project is a task described under following <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2024/projects/1/minesweeper/"> link</a>. In shortcut: this a minesweeper game, where you can use AI in order to make a safe move for you. If no safe move is possible, a random move is made. AI is implemented using prepositional logic described in the next section.

All UI elements have already been given. All classes and methods regarding prepositional logic have been implemented by myself.

## About solution
Knowledge is represented by sentences constructed like this:

```python
{A, B, C, D, E} = n
```

where {A, B, C, D, E} are cell indexes and n is a number of cells that are known to contain bombs between all {A, B, C, D, E} cells.

It turns out that all inferences one can take are described by 5 simple rules

* if {A, B, C} = 0 then A, B, C are safe,
* if {A, B, C} = 3 then A, B, C are bombs,
* if {A, B, C} = 2 and C is safe then {A, B} = 2,
* if {A, B, C} = 2 and C is mine then {A, B} = 1,
* if {A, B, C, D, E} = 2 and {A, B, C} = 1 then {D, E} = 1.

First four inferences seem to be quite logical and they need no further explanation. Regarding last inference: more generally, any time we have two sentences set1 = count1 and set2 = count2 where set1 is a subset of set2, then we can construct the new sentence set2 - set1 = count2 - count1. Consider the example above to ensure you understand why thatâ€™s true.

## Prerequisities
In order to run the projects, there is need to install pygame package. For windows:

```bash
pip install pygame
```
